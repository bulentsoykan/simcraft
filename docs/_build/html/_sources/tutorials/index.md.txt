## Tutorial Overview

| Tutorial | Level | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| [Building Your First Simulation](first_simulation) | Beginner | Create a complete simulation from scratch |
| [Reinforcement Learning Integration](rl_integration) | Advanced | Connect SimCraft to RL frameworks |

## Prerequisites

Before starting these tutorials, you should:

1. Have SimCraft installed (see [Installation](../installation))
2. Be familiar with Python classes and object-oriented programming
3. Understand basic discrete event simulation concepts

## Learning Path

**Beginner**: Start with [Building Your First Simulation](first_simulation) to understand the core concepts.

**Intermediate**: Explore the [Examples](../examples/index) to see complete simulation models.

**Advanced**: Learn how to integrate with optimization and RL frameworks in [RL Integration](rl_integration).
